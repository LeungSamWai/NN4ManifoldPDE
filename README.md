# Solving PDEs on Manifold With Machine Learning
By Senwei Liang, Shixiao Jiang, John Harlim, Haizhao Yang

## Introduction
The repository is the implementation of the paper "Solving PDEs on Unknown Manifolds With Machine Learning" [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/). The basic idea is to approximate the differential operator by diffusion maps, and then we apply a deep neural network to solve the discretized system.

## Requirement
* Matlab
* Python 3.6 and Pytorch
